        "The idea of this project is to walk you through the way I tackled a problem that I found interesting and worth exploring: can you solve a Rubik's cube using Simulated Annealing. The most popular ways of solving the cube are either by applying a set of rules, depending on the configuration of the cube at each stage of the solving process, or using graph search algorithms, like A*, or Kociembaâ€™s algorithm. But I wanted to know if you can use a Genetic Algorithm, like Simulated Annealing, to solve the problem, not by simply brute-forcing all combinations and finding the fastest way to the solution. So here I'm attempting exactly this.\n",

Rotations of middle rows are ignored as well because 1. they would result in the middle tiles moving, and 2. the same movement can be ahieved with two rotations of the neighbouring rows, so it's better to keep it simple.

To do so, one can go about different ways, such as hard-coding each move, but here a look-up table (`ROTATION_LOOKUP_TABLE`) is used to succinctly encompass all the necessary movements that we want to do. Because we've already decided that only the outer rows on each side can move, then the possible moves are only 12, which are the rotations of each side (including the clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) rotations).

        "We also need a function that flips the order of the tiles in a row/col. Because we're using a flattened 2D representation of the 3D cube, some rotations will result in, say a row from one face being mapped into a col on another, but in reverse. You can take the CW rotation of the blue face(face 2) and see that the left col from the yellow face(face 6) will replace the right col of the red face(face 3). But because of the nature of the rotation, the tiles will be upside-down after the rotation (sitting on the red face) from how they were before the rotation (when they were on the yellow face). So we need the `flip_XOR` function to account for that. \n",
        "\n",
        "The way I've encoded the rotations in the `ROTATION_LOOKUP_TABLE` means that we can figure out if a flip is needed by comparing the first two parameters of the row/col before and after the transformation. The color of the tiles doesn't play a role. If either of the two parameters is the same before and after the transformation, then a flip is needed. So a transformation from [0,1,..] -> [0,0,..] needs a flip because the first coordinate is 0 for both, but the second is different. If both, or neither of the two parameters are the same, then no flip is needed, say for [0,1,..] -> [2,0,..]. Overall this acts as a XOR gate, if we raise -1 to the power of the number of differing parameter. The output of -1 means flip, and 1 means keep the same. "

The algorithm starts with a temperature T, and after each move, this temperature decreases by a fixed cooling rate, analogous to annealing in metallurgy (but in metallurgy the cooling rate is usually not fixed). \n",

So then the Simulated Annealing algorithm is more like a Random Walk algorithm. If T<<Î” (here << and >> can be as little as x10 difference), then P will approach 0, making the algorithm closer to a Gradient Descent algorithm, where only the best move, or in our case one which decreases Î”, will be chosen. \n",

It solves a few moves and many times increases the orderness of the cube, but gets stuck and cannot continue, as the temperature gets too low and the algorithm is not able to really take \"wrong\" moves, so it cannot escape its local minima. Giving it a boost by increasing the temperature, or rewinding a few moves doesn't seem to fix the problem, it still gets stuck on the same move, or maybe 1-2 moves further. For smaller number of mixing moves it seems to still find solutions, yet not always. For 1 mixing move it always finds the solution, for 2 moves - around 60-70% of the time, and it decreases down as we increase the moves. The largest number of moves observed that it is able to find a solution after 100 runs is 8, which is not little, but it still is not perfect. And this is usually because the mixing just turns out to be simpler, resembling more a 5 or 6 moves mixed cube.

        "My conclusion for this project is that Simulated Annealing is able to solve some Rubik's cubes, if they are a bit simpler, but is not a reliable way of finding the solution to the problem. It also takes a very large number of moves to reach a solution, more than if more conventional algorithms are used. So overall it's a fun way of approaching the problem, but better and faster methods exist, and it doesn't seem to improve on any aspect, other than maybe the complexity of coding the solution. "
